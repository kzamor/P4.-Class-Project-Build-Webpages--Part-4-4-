            <img src="/images/campus.jpg" alt="New Jersey Institute of Technology" width="600" height="400" style="float: left; margin-right: 30px;">As stated on the home page, my name is Kelvin Zamor. I am a junior Information Technology major at the New Jersey Institute of Technology specializing in Web Applications. My name is Kelvin Zamor, I am twenty years old, and I was born and raised in New Jersey, and I have lived here my whole life. I don't live on campus, and I commute to school. My parents were born and raised in Haiti, and they moved to New Jersey before I was born. I went to Newark Tech High School where I played varsity basketball as a shooting guard, and I also played volleyball. I was a middle blocker and an outside hitter while playing volleyball, and I also led the entire state of New Jersey in blocks. I also watch basketball, and my favorite team in the NBA is the Atlanta Hawks. I think LeBron James is the greatest basketball player ever. My birthday is on June 18th, 2003, so that makes me a Gemini. It's funny because I have a twin sister, and the Gemini's symbol is a pair of twins. I also have an older brother who is three years older than me. My hobbies are playing basketball, playing video games, working out, and watching anime. Some other random facts about me are I like turtles, I am 6 foot 3, and I listen to all genres and types of music. I also took karate for 4 years when I was a kid, and I like superheroes. Spiderman, the Flash, Batman, etc. </p>

            I aspire to be a front-end web developer in the future. Throughout my academic journey at NJIT, I've displayed a strong work ethic and a genuine eagerness to absorb new knowledge. This academic environment has honed my ability to swiftly grasp concepts. I leveraged these skills to initiate a personal project, crafting a Twitter Clone, now known as X. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, and C++. My logical thinking and collaborative nature make me an asset in team environments. I'm devoted to continuous learning in the ever-evolving tech sphere. </p>
